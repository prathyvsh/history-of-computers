* History of Computer Science
Exploring history of CS


By 1970s emphasis started to shift from computers that performed procedures to objects of computation and relations between them.

Programming languages began to be embedded in programming environments.

** Time sharing

Inspired from SAGE and SABRE developed by Jay Forrester.

** Virtual Machines

** UNIX

** Internet

** Structured Programming

*  Hardware
