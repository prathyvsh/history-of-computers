* History of Computer Science
Exploring history of CS


By 1970s emphasis started to shift from computers that performed procedures to objects of computation and relations between them.

Programming languages began to be embedded in programming environments.

** Time sharing

Inspired from SAGE and SABRE developed by Jay Forrester.

** Virtual Machines

** UNIX

** Internet

** Structured Programming

*  Hardware

Mercury Delay Lines
Cathode Ray Tubes
Diodes
Transistors
Integrate Circuits

First IC made its commercial appearance in IBM System 360 (1964)

** Fields of computer science today (roughly):

Determine if I should invoke the classification of Theory A vs. Theory B
- PLT
- Algorithms
- Computational complexity
- Numerical analysis
- Automata theory
- Formal languages and linguistics
- Databases
- Adaptive Systems
- Theorem proving
- Artificial Intelligence
- Pattern Recognition

* Switching Theory

E. F. Moore
G. H. Mealy

Universal algebra and algebraic structures were brought to bear upon machines and algebraic machine theory was well established by 1964.

Using these theoretical vantage point, one could evaluate patterns of input given to a machine as a mapping: partition of semigroups

Turing machines shifted attention from decidability to tractability and enabled classification of problems in terms of computing resources required for their solution.
